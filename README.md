## What is zygoat?

`zygoat` is a command line tool used to bootstrap and configure a React/Django/Postgres stack web application.

Linting, test configuration, boilerplate, and development environment are automatically taken care of using `zygoat` so that you can get up and running faster.

## How does it work?

We'll find out soon!
